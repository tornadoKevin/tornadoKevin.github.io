<h1>VIOLIN=MY LIFE</h1>
<p>And the violin is also widely regarded as <strong>one of the most difficult instruments to learn</strong>. One of the reasons behind this is that there are no guides on the violin for finger placement.</p>
<p> So, <em>yes, it's a very difficult instrument</em>, but if you master both the instrument and the bow, the results are amazing!</p>
