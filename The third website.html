<p>A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous car, driver-less car, or robotic car (robo-car),[1][2][3] is a car that is capable of traveling without human input.[</p>
<p>Self-driving cars use sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as optical and thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, ultrasound/sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units.</p>
<h2><strong>Google can be also known as artificial intelligence</strong></h2>
<p>Google Search is a form of narrow A<strong>I</strong>, as is predictive analytics, or virtual assistants. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) would be the ability for a machine to &ldquo;sense, think, and act&rdquo; just like a human.</p>

<h1 id="firstHeading">Space exploration</h1>
<div id="p-lang-btn"><br>
Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space.</div>
<p>While the exploration of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, </p>
<p>its physical exploration though is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight. </p>
<p>Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy, is one of the main sources for space science. </p>
